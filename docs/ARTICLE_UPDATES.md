# Portfolio Article — Required Updates

The published article "Why Your Todo App Doesn't Work" needs updates to reflect the redesigned thesis. The core B=MAP framework stays, but the product execution has changed significantly.

---

## What Changed

### Old thesis
"Apply Fogg's B=MAP to task management with features like 'I Have X Minutes', celebrations, and goal progress."

### New thesis
"The list itself is the problem. Hide it. Show one task at a time, matched to your energy. Shame-free, momentum-based, ADHD-informed."

---

## Sections to Update

### 1. The Hook / Introduction
**Old**: "Every todo app solves organization, none solve completion."
**Keep**: This framing still works perfectly. No change needed.

### 2. The Solution Section
**Update**: Replace feature list with the 5 design principles:
- Anti-List (one task at a time, not a scrollable list)
- Energy-First (adapt to current capacity)
- Shame-Free (no overdue badges, no streak resets)
- Momentum (physics-based, decays but never resets)
- Time Training (build time estimation skill)

### 3. Feature Descriptions
**Remove/replace**: "I Have X Minutes" as a standalone feature — it's now integrated into the Focus screen's energy-matching.

**Add**:
- Focus Screen walkthrough (energy → one card → timer → celebration)
- Momentum vs Streaks comparison (why momentum is better for ADHD)
- Time perception training (before/after estimate comparison)

### 4. Competitive Differentiation
**Add a section**: Table comparing DO to Todoist, Things 3, Goblin.tools, Habitica. Show what's actually novel vs what already exists in market.

### 5. ADHD Research
**Add citations**:
- Dr. Russell Barkley on time blindness
- Brendan Mahan's "Wall of Awful"
- Dr. Ned Hallowell on structured external systems
- The "Now vs Not Now" brain concept

### 6. Screenshots / Demo
**Replace**: Old screenshots with new Focus screen flow (energy selector → focus card → timer → celebration)

## Tone Adjustment

The article currently has a confident tone about behavioral science application. The redesign makes the argument sharper: **it's not just about applying Fogg — it's about recognizing that the list UI itself is the failure mode that every other app ignores.**

This is a stronger portfolio argument because it shows:
1. You identified a design assumption the entire market shares (lists as default)
2. You challenged it with research (ADHD, decision paralysis, Fogg)
3. You built a concrete alternative (one-task-at-a-time Focus mode)
